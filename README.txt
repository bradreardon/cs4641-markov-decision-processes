Author: Bradley Reardon

Code

Requirements

    - Java 1.7 or above
    - An IDE, or other way of easily running main() functions in Java classes

Running

    For this project, I used IntelliJ IDEA to run code. Import the project via pom.xml into whatever IDE is preferred. Afterward, running a build should link the project and download any necessary libraries. Then, running any of the classes in the assignment4 package should allow the code to run.
